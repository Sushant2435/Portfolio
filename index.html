                <p>
                    Thank you for giving this wonderful opportunity to me to introduce myself to you. I am Sushant sharma. We are four members in my family including me.  
                    I am native to Gurgaon, and open to relocate to Gurgaon. 
                    Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech in Cse at the DCE, and I will be entering into 2nd  year of my graduation studies. 
                    Ever since, I started studying cse in my school days. I realized,
                     I enjoy analyzing things connected to the society, and the Mother Nature. Since my childhood days, 
                     I have witnessed my family focusing upon correct utilization of house hold items, 
                     and guiding us towards understanding the whites, and blacks of the possible outcomes. 
                     I believe, this somehow further boosted my interest towards CS as a career option.

                <h2>Web design</h2>
                <p>
                    Web design refers to the design of 
                    websites that are displayed on the
                     internet. It usually refers to the 
                     user experience aspects of website 
                     development rather than software 
                     development. Web design used to be
                      focused on designing websites for
                       desktop browsers; however, since 
                       the mid-2010s, design for mobile and 
                       tablet browsers has become 
                       ever-increasingly important.

                <h2>web development</h2>
                <p>
                    A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.

                <p>
                    Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser.
